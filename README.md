# Material Darker JupyterLab Extension

The Material Darker theme for JupyterLab

## Install

The extension is not yet uploaded to npm, so in order to install it you need to clone the repository, enter the main directory, and run:

```
npm run build
jupyter labextension install
```

(If you get this error in the build process: `ERROR in Entry module not found: Error: Can't resolve 'style-loader'`, run `npm install style-loader --save` and try building again)

After launching JupyterLab, select the `Material Darker` theme from the main menu: `Settings` > `JupyterLab Theme` > `Material Darker`
